What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

In Git, merge and rebase are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch into another. 
A merge creates a new commit that combines the changes from two or more branches, while a rebase rewrites the history of the branch being rebased. 
Merge preserves the history of both branches, while rebase creates a cleaner, linear history, but can be more complex and requires more attention.

What is a remote repository? 

A remote repository in Git is a copy of a project's codebase stored on a separate server. 
It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the project and keep their local copies in sync with the latest changes made by other team members.
