# Homework 1

This homework will help you get familiar with git and github, tools you'll be using later on in this class and your career. At the end of this exercise, you should have created two branches, created a merge conflict, resolved it, and then pushed the results to your github repository. 

You can follow the steps below, but please note that a number of them have been deleted, mostly things like when to use "git add" and "git commit". Simply following these steps verbatim will result in your project becoming an intractable mess.

1. Read this: https://towardsdatascience.com/get-git-a-primer-on-git-aa2cd1d9436f
2. Create a <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/command-line-GitHub-fork-CLI-terminal-shell#:~:text=A%20fork%20in%20Git%20is,that%20of%20the%20original%20project.">fork</a> of this repository (there should be a fork button on this page in the upper right).
3. Create a file called "answers.txt"
5. In answers.txt, paste the following and answer the question:

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

7. Create a branch called "progress" and switch to it.
8. Paste the following into "answers.txt" and answer the question.

9. Switch back to "main" and merge the main branch with the progress branch such that both your answers are in order in answers.txt
12. Submit a link to your github project.
